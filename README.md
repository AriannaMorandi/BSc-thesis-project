Innovation and Productivity Growth: An Econometric Analysis
This project analyzes the impact of innovation on productivity growth across 10 European countries with diverse economic backgrounds. The analysis uses three key indicators of innovation: R&D investment, labor force, and patent activity.

Methodology
Data: Collected from the OECD database.
Approach: The analysis begins with graphical exploration of each variable, followed by individual regressions linking the three innovation proxies to productivity. A multiple regression model is then constructed, incorporating entity and time fixed effects, with lagged variables to capture delayed impacts.
Goal: To offer insights into how innovation drives productivity growth, using econometric models to assess the influence of these factors.
The project includes model estimations and visualizations to present the results.
